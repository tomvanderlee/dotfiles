Toms Dotfiles
=============
###About
Recently I've been discovering tiling window managers and how nice it is to customize my desktop.
This means I've got a "lot" of dotfiles wanting to share across my machines and with everyone who is interested.
###How to install
You can
 - copy the files to your home directory

or
 - You can run install my dotfiles with the Makefile

The makefile has multiple recepies:
 - numix-no-title: Installs a modified version of the numix metacity theme
 - herbstluftwm: Installs my herbstluftwm dotfiles
 - bash: Installs my bashrc file
 - vim: Installs my vimrc file
 - xresources: Installs my xresources file
 - install: Does all of the above
 - uninstall: uninstall all my dotfiles

###Disclaimer
I am not responsible for the loss of any of your files! You should make a backup before installing anything!
