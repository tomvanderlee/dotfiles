Toms Dotfiles
=============

###About
Recently I've been discovering tiling window managers and that customizeing my desktop is really cool.
This means I've got a "lot" of dotfiles I want to share across my machines and with everyone who is interested.

###How to install
You can
 - copy the files to your home directory

or 
 - You can run make install to stow all dotfiles to your home directory (recommanded)

The makefile has two recepies:
 - install: Installs all my dotfiles to your $HOME
 - uninstall: Uninstalls all my dotfiles

The makefile depends on GNU Stow.
